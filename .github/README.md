This editor is written from scratch and most of it is taken from [antirez/kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo). Things that are added on top of kilo are:

- [x] Line Numbers
- [x] Auto indentation
- [x] Auto completing brackets and quotes 
- [x] Modal based (vim) editing 
- [x] Much more fancier status bar
- [ ] Multiple buffers 
- [ ] Selection based editing
- [ ] Bufferline
- [ ] Undo and Redo
